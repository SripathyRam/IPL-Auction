# IPL-Auction

The online IPL auction project using Java and concurrent server models is a system that allows users to participate in an auction for players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament. The system is based on a client-server architecture, where clients can connect to a server to participate in the auction.

During the auction, clients can place bids on players using the system's user interface. The server receives these bids and updates the auction. The system also allows clients to view the current state of the auction, including the current highest bid for each player.

Once the auction is complete, the system determines the winning bidders for each player and updates the database accordingly. Clients can then view the final results of the auction
